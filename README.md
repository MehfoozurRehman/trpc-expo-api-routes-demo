# ðŸ§© Demo app for integrating tRPC with Expo API routes

With the release of [Expo SDK 50](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023/12-12-sdk-50-beta), Expo Router now enables you to write server code on your Expo projects through the new [API Routes](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes).

This is an example app that shows how you can setup [tRPC](https://trpc.io) on Expo with API Routes. This lets developers achieve full-stack typesafety on all of Expo's supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web, and nowâ€”server.
